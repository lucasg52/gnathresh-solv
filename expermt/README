2_side_branch_distances changes the distances of two side branches from the AIS and records the gna.
2_side_branches_lengths changes the lengths of the two side branches situated at 1.6 and 2.4 lambda, respectively. Gna is recorded for each combination.
side_and_sub_branches_distances changes the distance a side branch and a sub branch are from the AIS. A second side branch does not exist. The lengths are 4 lambdas each. Gna is recorded at each combination.
