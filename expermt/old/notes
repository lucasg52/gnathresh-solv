To-Do:

Look into outputting raw h.Vector data into files (raw data files), for better analysis--see if its even that useful
  Turns out this is quite east w/ numpy.save and numpy.load very convienent

Play around more with programatic sim control:
  What is the point of h.finitialize? h.continuerun?
  How long does it take to run the simulation? (do some stress-testing)
  is it possible to save the state of a simulatiuon and continue it later? (as the name h.continuerun would suggest)
  	a: yes, h.continuerun runs UNTIL the specified time
