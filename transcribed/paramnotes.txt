Stim-site:
	- Amplitude:
		0.2
	- Duration:
		0.3125 ms (laura notes that this is equal to 5/16 ms)
	- Delays:
		only seen in PropogationSearch.hoc and simulation_base.goc
		5ms, 10 ms for double pulse(?)
		sometimes assigned to var "tstart"
		in PropagationSearch.hoc a contitional statement looks for max voltage 1 ms after stimulation begins
		in PropagationSearch.hoc it is set to 0 (w/comment) for some reason
	- x (on parent branch):

Soma:
	- membrane potential (?):
		-80, -70, -60 mV (vs-expcell...hoc files)
	- leak:
		0.002 (vs-expcell.hoc, called with set)

Initial Segment:
	e_pas:
		-80, -70, -60mV (vs-expcell...hoc files)
	g_pas:
		0.001 (vs-expcell...hoc files)


Misc:
	- dt:
		0.001 (vs-expcell...hoc files)
	- model:
		Traub is used in vs-expcell.hoc
		Modified Traub appears to be M.K's model of choice (vs_expcell.hoc)
		standard hh is not used
	- sim time:
		tstop = 20 (kinetics_wholecell.hoc, proc insertwhole_Traub)(im assuming tstop is a global var that is being accessed..?)
		according to laura this is a parameter that exists in the gui but its not clear if neuron.h has an attribute equivalent 

Needed:
	- dx
	- any other pas params I can get my hands on (already looked thru traub params thoroughly, standard hh not used)
