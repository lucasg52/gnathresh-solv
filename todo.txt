Lucas:
  - Reading old plaintext files from Beloit 2018, loading into arrays and whatnot
  	--Done.
  - Visualization for old data from Beloit 2018
  	--Done.
  - Get correct parameters for model
    --Mostly done. All paramaters appear to lie in just a few files, along with the modfiles (see experimentation/paramnotes for more details)
    --Better yet: get old model directly imported into environment from old code
  - Create standard environment for interractive commandline simulation (centralized codebase, better IDLE interraction)
